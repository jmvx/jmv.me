<p>I graduated from <a href="http://rpi.edu/dept/math/" alt="link to rpi math department" target="_blank">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> in 2011 with a B.Sci. in Mathematics and from <a href="https://gse-step.stanford.edu/" alt="link to stanford STEP homepage" target="_blank">Stanford University</a> in 2012 with an M.A. in Secondary Education. I worked as a freelance web developer and public school teacher until 2015.</p>

<p>Lately, I've been designing, creating, and teaching online courses at <a href="https://www.udacity.com" alt="link to udacity" target="_blank">Udacity</a>, an online education startup in Silicon Valley. I am currently working on courses that teach the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ruby-programming-nanodegree--nd010" alt="ruby at udacity" target="_blank">Ruby</a> programming language and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ruby-on-rails-developer--nd020" alt="ruby on rails at udacity" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> web development framework.</p>
