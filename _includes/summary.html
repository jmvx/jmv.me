<p class="featured">I am a teacher. Let me make your website.</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="http://rpi.edu/dept/math/" target="_blank">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> in 2011 with a B.S. in Mathematics and from <a href="https://gse-step.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford University</a> in 2012 with an M.A. in Secondary Education.</p>
