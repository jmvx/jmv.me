<p class="featured">Hello, World!</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="http://rpi.edu/dept/math/" alt="link to rpi math department" target="_blank">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> and <a href="https://gse-step.stanford.edu/" alt="link to stanford STEP homepage" target="_blank">Stanford University</a> with degrees in Mathematics and Secondary Education. I taught middle school mathematics for 3 years before joining <a href="https://www.udacity.com" alt="link to udacity" target="_blank">Udacity</a> as a Course Developer, where I taught online programming courses until January 2017.
