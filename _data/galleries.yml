      caption: "We arrived just in time for the Sherlock Holmes Museum at 221B Baker Street. However, it wasn’t clear that the line outside the museum was not the line to buy tickets. They denied us admission since they closed the registers before we reached the door. Note to self Buy tickets in the gift shop first, then get in line."

      caption: Our visit to the Tower of London started with a tour led by a Yeoman Warder who talked about the high-profile executions that took place at the tower. Afterwards, we saw the crown jewels, which are located in a large vault. There is a moving walkway to keep visitors from staring at the jewels too long. We weren’t allowed to take pictures of the jewels.

    caption: One of my favorite views in Paris is from the top of L’Arc de Triomphe, but it’s not easy to get to. There is a long spiral staircase that brings you to the top. It’s a long way up, so take it slow. There are benches at the top of the stairs for you to sit and catch your breath before finally exiting to the “roof” area of the where you can take pictures of the amazing views.

    caption: I googled “locks on bridge in Paris” and it turns out that there are a few of them. Wikipedia lists the Pont des Arts, Passerelle Léopold-Sédar-Senghor, and the Pont de l’Archevêché are three bridges in Paris that have love locks. I don’t know which one we visited, but it was very cute nonetheless.

    caption: Notre Dame Cathedral is beautiful, but a bit like your average church as tours go. It’s possible to take a tour up in the towers, but we didn’t get a chance to. It’s definitely something I would like to do next time I’m in Paris.

    caption: As a fan of the Phantom of the Opera, I was drawn to visit the Paris Opera House. (The opera house is also conveniently located across the street from the Paris Apple Store.) Unfortunately we showed up too late and couldn’t finish a full tour. The staff are very strict on closing hours.

    caption: Finally, our trip would not be complete without being robbed by two kids at an ATM near our Paris apartment. We weren’t familiar with the machine, which allowed the thieves to withdraw money after we had reclaimed our card and left the scene.

    caption: The Eiffel Tower is big, but not very interesting. On our way there, we found some scammers preying on some poor tourists. By this time, we were pretty good at identifying their tactics. Beware the “survey girls”.

    caption: We took the RER and spent a day at the Palace at Versailles. The palace was grand, but if you are short on time I would just do a tour of the gardens which are unbelievable. If you arrive in time for Les Grandes Eaux Musicales, they will have soft music playing while you tour the gardens and some mini-Bellagio-esque fountain shows.

    caption: My instructor and photographer were JP and Jordan, respectively. In short, they were the coolest skydivers in Byron and I'm really happy my first skydive was with them.

    thumb: skydive-gopro-2_thumb.jpg
    caption: We flew up to 13,000 feet in a tiny plane. I was honestly more worried about the plane ride than the actual skydive. I sometimes get motion-sickness when I'm on small, bumpy flights. I made it, though... And, I even decided to jump first! The fear hadn't quite hit me yet; I was feeling too badass and was also pretty distracted by the awesome view.

    caption: I had mentioned to JP before the jump that I was worried about the feeling you get in your stomach when you suddenly start to fall. To my surprise, he said you don't feel it since you're already moving at high speeds once you're in the airplane! Yay physics!

    thumb: skydive-gopro-8_thumb.jpg
    caption: Shortly after this photo was taken, Jordan parachutes away so he can meet us on the ground later. I will mention, that we had a minor mishap with the parachute when it opened. It got twisted, so we had to kick our legs to untwist ourselves which gave JP a rope burn on his neck.

    thumb: skydive-gopro-9_thumb.jpg
    caption: After we got the parachute twist sorted out, JP let me steer the parachute. It was fun for a bit, but unfortunately my motion sickness started to kick in and I had to stop. All the swooping motions were pretty disorienting. JP took over again, and we slowly glided our way back to the landing pad.
