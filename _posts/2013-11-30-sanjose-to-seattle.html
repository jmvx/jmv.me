<p>We decided to go on a road trip with friends for Thanksgiving Break. (San Jose, Portland, and Seattle.) A couple highlights I want to first mention (and are not pictured below) are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://groundkontrol.com/" target="_blank">Ground Kontrol:</a> An awesome arcade bar. Tuesday nights are Rock Band night!</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ipictheaters.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">iPic Theaters:</a> A movie theater where the seats are plush leather and you can drink a beer during the show.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are more highlights from our trip.</p>
