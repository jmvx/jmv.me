<p>Caffe Frascati is a trendy European-style café in downtown San Jose. When I first heard about the café, its website was very basic, so I spent a weekend <a href="https://github.com/jmvx/jmvx.github.com/tree/master/private/frascati" target="_blank">mocking up</a> my own idea for a café site.</p>

<p>At some point Ryan spoke with the proprietario of Caffe Frascati and mentioned that I was interested in building a website for him. A few days later we met to work on creating a design that reflected the café’s established style.</p>

<p>Like Blades, this site was also hand-crafted using HTML, CSS, and jQuery, using Jekyll for templating and building static pages.</p>

<p>One major goal was to make it easier to update the events page without editing it by hand. The page fetches JSON data from a Google Calendar and produces the event list on the fly.</p>

<p>The café’s menu is extensive, so the menu page features expanding sections so that section headings are visible from the start. Since scrollbars are not always visible on iOS and OS X, it can be unclear that there is any content past the bottom-page cutoff due to the fixed-height design.</p>
