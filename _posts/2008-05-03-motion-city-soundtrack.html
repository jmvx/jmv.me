<p>My freshman-year roommate is a huge fan of Motion City Soundtrack. So, when she found out that they were coming to the RPI Field House, she became the happiest person in the world. I went to the concert with her and even got them to sign my program after the show.</p>

<p>This was also my first real rock concert, and Ryan even went with me. :)</p>
