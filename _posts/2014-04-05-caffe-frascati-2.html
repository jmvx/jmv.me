<h1>Background</h1>
<p>After the launch of Caffe Frascati's <a href="http://jmv.me/blog/caffe-frascati/" target="_blank">new website</a>, I continued to refine my design and research ways to bring more of the Caffe's bold style into the design.</p>

<img class="large" src="{{ page.image }}" />

<h1>Elements</h1>
<p>The website is still built with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and templated with Jekyll.</p>

<h1>Process</h1>

<p>The height of each page is variable, which gives more freedom with layout and amount of content. The menu is no longer expanding, but there isn't as much need for it with the increased amount of space.</p>

<p>I used a 3rd party jQuery plugin called <a href="http://freqdec.github.io/slabText/" target="_blank">SlabText</a> to style the featured event on the front page, which resembles the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/slideshow/caffe-frascati-grand-opening#slide=10" target="_blank">signage</a> style that Caffe Frascati often uses.
