<p>I am currently working on creating an iMessage bot that will answer queries about Caltrain arrival times. My initial design idea includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>"next san jose north" will tell you when the next northbound trains from San Jose will be.</li>
    <li>"last san francisco south" will tell you when the last train leaving  San Francisco will be.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually, I would also like it to specify whether the train arriving is a bullet or local train.</p>
