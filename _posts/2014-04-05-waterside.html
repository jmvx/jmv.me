<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Waterside is a landscaping company based in the US and UK. Their website was originally created using iWeb, but after it was discontinued they asked for alternative solutions.</p>

<h1>Elements</h1>
<p>The website was built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I used Jekyll for templating and to build static pages.</p>

<h1>Process</h1>
<p>Since Waterside did not yet have an established branding, I had more freedom with the design of their site. I experimented with a large full-width slideshow to showcase their design ideas and projects. I used a 3-column layout on the front page to summarize information about the business such as services and testimonials. In order to accommodate for the large number of testimonials Waterside has accumulated over the years, I used jQuery to rotate through the list.</p>

<p>Their contact page has a custom form that forwards messages to Waterside through <a href="http://forms.brace.io" target="_blank">Formspree</a>. And, in order to make it easier to update the Gallery page, I linked it to Waterside's Flickr account using <a href="http://www.simpleviewer.net/simpleviewer/" target="_blank">SimpleViewer</a>.</p>
