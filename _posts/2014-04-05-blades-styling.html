<p>This was my first freelance web design project. It is a small, three page site I constructed the website by hand using HTML and CSS, with jQuery to make the custom slideshow on the front page.</p>

<img class="large" src="{{ page.image }}" />

<p>I originally maintained the pages individually, but I realized the lack of efficiency very quickly whenever there was a change in the hours and I needed to update the hours separately on each page.</p>

<p>I had used include() in PHP before to make simple page templates, but decided instead to learn a bit about Jekyll since it can produce static files.</p>

<p>The slideshow has undergone many changes since its original version. I learned about jQuery animations and timing functions, but found that my original implementation had high CPU usage. The updated version uses JavaScript to set up a CSS animation which seems much more efficient.</p>

<p>It’s important to me that the contact information for a business always remain visible, on any page the user navigates to. I also focused on keeping a fixed-height layout appropriate for small screen sizes. This decision made it difficult to create an “About Us” page that contained staff bios, schedules, and contact information. I continually tweaked the margins and font sizes to make the content readable.</p>

<p>I visited the salon early on to take photos for the front page slideshow and staff headshots for the “About Us” page. The photos were taken with a Panasonic Lumix GX-1 and lightly edited in Aperture.</p>
