<p>In October 2008, I participated in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100610072544/http://ballroom.union.rpi.edu/team/results/2008-UConn" target="_blank">University of Connecticut Ballroom Competition</a>. I received 4th place in Newcomer Rhythm Swing with my partner Samantha Avery.</p>

<p>Since almost everyone in the video is wearing a black dress like me, it is easier to find me by looking for my partner Samantha. She is wearing a white blouse.</p>
