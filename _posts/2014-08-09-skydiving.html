<p>I was determined to jump out of a plane this summer, so <a href="http://ryan.govost.es" target="_blank">Ryan</a>, <a href="http://stipicevic.com" target="_blank">Mike</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/propellerhat" target="_blank">Jay</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wmobit" target="_blank">Matt</a>, and I went to <a href="http://www.bayareaskydiving.com" target="_blank">Bay Area Skydiving</a> in Byron, California. I did quite a bit of research into tandem skydiving locations before picking this place. It had <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/bay-area-skydiving-byron" target="_blank">good reviews</a> and seemed to pay enough attention to safety that I was fairly comfortable putting my life in their hands.</p>

<p>Jordan recorded both video and photos, so I was very happy to get copies of both once it was over. I love rewatching my video and I still feel giddy everytime I see myself make the first jump.</p>
