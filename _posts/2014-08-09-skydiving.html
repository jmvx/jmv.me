<p>I was determined to jump out of a plane this summer, so <a href="http://ryan.govost.es" target="_blank">Ryan</a>, <a href="http://stipicevic.com" target="_blank">Mike</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/propellerhat" target="_blank">Jay</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wmobit" target="_blank">Matt</a>, and I went to <a href="http://www.bayareaskydiving.com" target="_blank">Bay Area Skydiving</a> in Byron, California. I did quite a bit of research into tandem skydiving locations before picking this place. It had <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/bay-area-skydiving-byron" target="_blank">good reviews</a> and seemed to pay enough attention to safety that I was fairly comfortable putting my life in their hands.</p>

<p>My instructor and photographer were JP and Jordan, respectively. In short, they were the coolest skydivers in Byron and I'm really happy my first skydive was with them.</p>

<p>We flew up to 13,000 feet in a tiny plane. I was honestly more worried about the plane ride than the actual skydive. I sometimes get motion-sickness when I'm on small, bumpy flights. I made it, though... And, I even decided to jump first! The fear hadn't quite hit me yet; I was feeling too badass and was also pretty distracted by the awesome view. </p>

<p>Then JP pushes me out of the plane, and I start to realize what's happening...</p>

<p>I had mentioned to JP before the jump that I was worried about the feeling you get in your stomach when you suddenly start to fall. To my surprise, he said you don't feel it since you're already moving at high speeds once you're in the airplane! Yay physics!</p>

<p>I give the thumbs up to Jordan 'cause I'm feeling awesome.</p>

<p>This is my final Rock On/Peace Out to Jordan as JP prepares to deploy the parachute.</p>

<p>Shortly after this photo was taken, Jordan parachutes away so he can meet us on the ground later. I will mention, that we had a minor mishap with the parachute when it opened. It got twisted, so we had to kick our legs to untwist ourselves which gave JP a rope burn on his neck. </p>

<p>After we got the parachute twist sorted out, JP let me steer the parachute. It was fun for a bit, but unfortunately my motion sickness started to kick in and I had to stop. All the swooping motions were pretty disorienting. JP took over again, and we slowly glided our way back to the landing pad.</p>

<p>Jordan recorded both video and photos, so I was very happy to get copies of both once it was over. I love rewatching my video and I still feel giddy everytime I see myself make the first jump.</p>
