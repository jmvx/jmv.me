<p>I didn't take Earth Science in high school. So, I decided to take some Coursera courses to learn more about the Earth and the Solar System. One course called The Science of the Solar System is taught by "Pluto killer" Mike Brown from Caltech. I am willing to overlook the fact that he killed Pluto since his lectures are incredibly interesting.</p>

<p>While watching one of his lectures, I was motivated to write a python program that calculates the amount of time in months that it takes to fly to any particular planet.</p>
