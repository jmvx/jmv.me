<p>My summer of 2013 started with an amazing week in France. Here are some highlights:</p>

<img src="{{ page.image }}" class="large center" />
<p>We took the RER and spent a day at the Palace at Versailles. The palace was grand, but if you are short on time I would just do a tour of the gardens which are unbelievable. If you arrive in time for Les Grandes Eaux Musicales, they will have soft music playing while you tour the gardens and some mini-Bellagio-esque fountain shows.</p>

<p>We waited in the rain for hours to walk through the Catacombs.</p>

<p>As a fan of the Phantom of the Opera, I was drawn to visit the Paris Opera House. (The opera house is also conveniently located across the street from the Paris Apple Store.) Unfortunately we showed up too late and couldn’t finish a full tour. The staff are very strict on closing hours.</p>

<p>We saw the Moulin Rouge late at night.</p>

<p>Notre Dame Cathedral is beautiful, but a bit like your average church as tours go. It’s possible to take a tour up in the towers, but we didn’t get a chance to. It’s definitely something I would like to do next time I’m in Paris.</p>

<p>There is a museum and a mall inside the Louvre. You can also get a neat view of the inverted pyramid from the top floor of the Louvre Apple Store.</p>

<p>Ron Mueck is a contemporary artist who makes hyperrealistic sculptures that can be very eerie. We weren’t allowed to take pictures in the exhibit.</p>

<p>Finally, our trip would not be complete without being robbed by two kids at an ATM near our Paris apartment. We weren’t familiar with the machine, which allowed the thieves to withdraw money after we had reclaimed our card and left the scene.</p>

<p>Update: Bank of America refunded the money that was stolen by the boys.</p>

<img src="/images/survey-girls.jpg" class="large center" />
<p>The Eiffel Tower is big, but not very interesting. On our way there, we found some scammers preying on some poor tourists. By this time, we were pretty good at identifying their tactics. Beware the “survey girls”.</p>

<img src="/images/love-locks.jpg" class="large center" />
<p>I googled “locks on bridge in Paris” and it turns out that there are a few of them. Wikipedia lists the Pont des Arts, Passerelle Léopold-Sédar-Senghor, and the Pont de l’Archevêché are three bridges in Paris that have love locks. I don’t know which one we visited, but it was very cute nonetheless.</p>

<img src="/images/arc-triomphe.jpg" class="large center" />
<p>One of my favorite views in Paris is from the top of L’Arc de Triomphe, but it’s not easy to get to. There is a long spiral staircase that brings you to the top. It’s a long way up, so take it slow. There are benches at the top of the stairs for you to sit and catch your breath before finally exiting to the “roof” area of the where you can take pictures of the amazing views.</p>
