<p>I have some of my favorite articles framed and displayed above my bookcase, but I wanted to see what was left on <a href="http://poly.rpi.edu/" target="_blank">poly.rpi.edu</a>. If you search “Julia Van Cleve” you will find only two articles. One is a <a href="http://poly.rpi.edu/2010/07/16/research-briefs/" target="_blank">research brief</a> giving an  overview of some noteworthy research. The other is an editorial/opinion article where I wrote about stepping out of my <a href="http://poly.rpi.edu/2010/01/27/step-outside-your-comfort-zone/" target="_blank">comfort zone</a> by taking additional computer science courses—a choice I am very glad I made. I am sad that I couldn’t find more. One of my favorites, which isn’t on the Poly website as far as I can tell, is an article I wrote together with <a href="http://klottman.com/" target="_blank">Kelly Catalfamo</a> about gender-neutral housing. Since it’s all I have left, you can read the un-edited first draft of the article below:</p>

<h1>The following is an open letter to the Division of Student Life and President Shirley Ann Jackson:</h1>

<p>“I’m just curious … what would be the argument against gender-neutral housing?” asked a student attending the Rensselaer Student Association’s On-Campus Housing Forum on Thursday, February 3. Gender-neutral housing, which allows co-ed dorms and suites, is becoming a common practice at universities throughout the nation, including all of the Ivy League—and students at RPI would welcome it, if RSA’s forum was any indication.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Associate Dean of Residence Life Amanda Bingel informed the curious student that the Board of Trustees, members of the administration, and parents were resistant to the idea of gender-neutral housing. She gave the impression that this was because of changing social norms, and that the idea of unmarried students of the opposite gender living together was scandalous to the older generation.</p>

<p>This is a shame, because changing social norms are not just about extramarital sex; they are about acceptance. Just as shifting attitudes have made cohabitation more acceptable, they have made lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender lifestyles part of the norm. Universities taking steps toward gender-neutral housing are taking steps toward inclusiveness; this is about progress, not promiscuity. The change will “broaden students’ choices and help ensure living arrangements that are welcoming and inclusive for all,” said deans at Columbia University, which recently announced a pilot program for gender-blind doubles.</p>

<p>Gender-neutral housing pilots have passed at institutions such as Stanford University, University of Michigan, and Yale University. These pilots illustrate the fact that gender-neutral housing can be approached in a variety of ways, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Stanford has gender-neutral housing for select residence halls—those that contain dorms with private bedrooms for each roommate—while University of Michigan has gender-neutral dorms on a case-by-case basis. Yale is currently experimenting with gender-neutral dorms for seniors and is waiting before extending it to other class years.</p>

<p>No matter how it is approached, a move to gender-neutral housing adds options for students who may not be content with traditional housing. For instance, students who are gay, bisexual, or transgender are not always comfortable with same-sex roommate arrangements. In extreme cases, roommate bullying can lead to suicide. After the death of Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi, a victim of roommate bullying, more discussions have ensued regarding how to make schools and colleges safer for LGBT students. While few cases are as extreme as Clementi’s, mistreatment of LGBT students is not unheard of.</p>

<p>Even with perfectly amicable roommates, queer students could feel uneasy living with someone of the same gender, in the same way a straight female might feel uneasy living with a straight male. Additionally, transgender students at schools without gender-neutral housing are often segregated, potentially creating a sense of social isolation. Opt-in gender-neutral housing allows students, not administrators, to designate the gender they feel most comfortable living with—whichever gender that may be.</p>

<p>This choice would not only benefit LGBT students. At a school with such a skewed gender ratio, it’s unlikely that a students’ group of friends is single-sex. Many students move off campus to live with a co-ed group, since this is not currently an option for on-campus housing (note: not every student promoting gender-neutral housing is trying to find an excuse to share a bed with their significant other). We the undersigned have both lived in apartments with mixed genders, and it’s never created a problem for us.</p>

<p>One of the few areas where the gender division did come up was the issue of bathrooms; however, if all roommates agree to keep things clean, this isn’t an issue for us, and probably wouldn’t be for most students. The bathrooms in residence halls like RAHPs and Polytech, or suite bathrooms such as those found in BARH or Quad, would be analogous to those in our apartment. In dorms with floor bathrooms, which are cleaned by cleaning staff and have private stalls, the gender divide would hardly be noticed.</p>

<p>But could gender-blind housing work at RPI? Sadly, the main thing standing in its way seems to be the Clustered Learning, Advocacy, and Support for Students initiative—or at least the initiative’s popular perception. Students simply see CLASS as something that robs them of independent choices at every turn—a trait that certainly wouldn’t mesh with gender-neutral housing. We’re sure the administration would argue that this is a misrepresentation of CLASS.</p>

<p>But does the administration really know what CLASS is? When we listen to them describe it, our eyes often glaze over after the fifteenth buzzword. But in a moment of clarity, Vice President for Student Life Eddie Ade Knowles describes the goal of the Sophomore-Year Experience, one component of CLASS, as “to provide students with a greater sense of belonging and community at Rensselaer as they continue to live in on-campus housing.” Additionally, President Shirley Ann Jackson cited one of her goals in <i>The Rensselaer Plan</i> as “creat[ing] a lively discourse on important cultural, social, gender, and ethnicity issues in courses, colloquia, fairs, and festivals as well as in residence halls, student activities, and the research environment.”</p>

<p>We believe that Knowles and Jackson really do care deeply about students at Rensselaer. We hope they won’t let themselves get lost in simply considering what looks good to the press, and give us instead something that embraces the diversity of students at Rensselaer, something tangible and positive to associate with CLASS that is consistent with their professed values. We can’t think of a better way to make students feel as though the “belong” and to promote “lively discourse on important cultural, social, [and] gender” issues than to institute opt-in gender-neutral housing.</p>

<p>So, we ask again, “what would be the argument against gender-neutral housing?” How does it not coincide with the values of CLASS or <i>The Rensselaer Plan</i>?</p>
