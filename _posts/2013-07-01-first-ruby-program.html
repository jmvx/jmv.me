<p>A long time ago, I wrote a password generator (called Peewee) using C++. In an effort to learn Ruby, I rewrote the program.</p>

<h1>New Password Generator in Ruby</h1>
{% highlight ruby %}
    {% include /code/rb-peewee.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

<h1>Old Password Generator in C++</h1>
{% highlight c++ %}
    {% include /code/cpp-peewee.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
