<p>In November 2008, I participated in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100610072451/http://ballroom.union.rpi.edu/team/results/2008-sbu" target="_blank">Stony Brook Ballroom Competition</a>. Below is a overview of how my partners and I placed in this competition. I danced with Florian Radu for Rhythm/Latin and Richard Rabin for Smooth/Standard.</p>

<ul>
    <li>1st Place – Newcomer Standard Waltz</li>
    <li>2nd Place – Newcomer Smooth Waltz</li>
    <li>3rd Place – Newcomer Standard Tango</li>
    <li>3rd Place – Newcomer Smooth Tango</li>
    <li>5th Place – Newcomer Smooth Foxtrot</li>
    <li>5th Place – Newcomer Latin Rumba</li>
    <li>6th Place – Newcomer Rhythm Rumba</li>
</ul>

<p>My partner Richard and I are in view at about 55 seconds in. We are in between two couples with red dresses. In case you still can’t find me, I do an underarm turn at 1:06. :)</p>
