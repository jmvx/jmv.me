<p>I just discovered what “egosurfing” is. While waiting for Ryan to return from dinner on a Friday night, I decided to Google my name and found an old pdf of the program my high school gave out.</p>

<p>To add to this very narcissistic blog post, I have summarized my high school academic achievements:<p>
<ul>
    <li>Social Science Award: For Academic Excellence and Achievement in Economics</li>
    <li>Drama Senior Service Award: For dramatic performance and service to the Drama Club</li>
    <li>The Dobris Mathematics Scholarship: Awarded to a senior female who has shown outstanding effort and scholarship in mathematics and intends to pursue a career in a mathematics related field.</li>
