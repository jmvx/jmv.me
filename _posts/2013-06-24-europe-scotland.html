<p>After a week in Paris, France, we took EasyJet to Scotland and stayed in a <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/39977" target="_blank">Bed & Breakfast</a> just outside of Glasgow. It was located within walking distance of train station, which made day trips to Glasgow Central and Edinburgh relatively simple.</p>

<p>The Riverside Museum is a popular transportation museum in Glasgow. One of the exhibits was a replica old-fashioned subway train. Interestingly, the subway trains haven’t changed much… They are still just as small as it looks in the picture.</p>

<p>We visited the Glasgow Botanic Gardens which featured some very interesting plants. One of them was the Mimosa Plant which moves reacts to your touch when you brush against its leaves.</p>

<p>Also at the Glasgow Botanic Gardens is a “Killer Plant” exhibit. The Pitcher Plants are my favorites.</p>

<p>Next time, we would like to hike to the top of Arthur’s Seat. For this trip to Edinburgh we focused on the Castle.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we didn’t encounter any <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213663/" target="_blank">killer robots</a> on the way to The World’s End.</p>

<p>This photo is for my dad. He says he has a picture of himself at Edinburgh Castle somewhere. :)</p>
