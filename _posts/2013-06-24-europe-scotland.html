<p>After a week in Paris, France, we took EasyJet to Scotland and stayed in a <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/39977" target="_blank">Bed & Breakfast</a> just outside of Glasgow. It was located within walking distance of train station, which made day trips to Glasgow Central and Edinburgh relatively simple.</p>
