<p>We took a train from Edinburgh to London and spent our final week in a small London flat with two flatmates. We also joined a tour group that allowed us to also visit Windsor, Stonehenge, and Bath.</p>

<p>We arrived just in time for the Sherlock Holmes Museum at 221B Baker Street. However, it wasn’t clear that the line outside the museum was <i>not</i> the line to buy tickets. They denied us admission since they closed the registers before we reached the door. Note to self: Buy tickets in the gift shop first, <i>then</i> get in line.</p>

<p>Our visit to the Tower of London started with a tour led by a Yeoman Warder who talked about the high-profile executions that took place at the tower. Afterwards, we saw the crown jewels, which are located in a large vault. There is a moving walkway to keep visitors from staring at the jewels too long. We weren’t allowed to take pictures of the jewels.</p>
