<p>I just discovered what “egosurfing” is. While waiting for Ryan to return from dinner on a Friday night, I decided to Google my name and found an old pdf of the program my high school gave out.</p>

<p>To add to this very narcissistic blog post, I have summarized my high school academic achievements:<p>
<ul>
    <li>Social Science Award: For Academic Excellence and Achievement in Economics</li>
    <li>Drama Senior Service Award: For dramatic performance and service to the Drama Club</li>
    <li>The Dobris Mathematics Scholarship: Awarded to a senior female who has shown outstanding effort and scholarship in mathematics and intends to pursue a career in a mathematics related field.</li>
    <li>Academic High Honors: Awarded to students who have achieved an average of 90% or above for each of the past three quarters of the 2006-2007 school year, while maintaining Honor Roll Status each quarter.</li>
    <li>President’s Award for Academic Excellence: Awarded to students who have achieved a cumulative grade point average of 90% and a score at the 85th percentile on a college placement examination.</li>
    <li>Mathematics Award: Academic Excellence and Achievement in AP Statistics
Valedictory Class: The valedictory class is made up of students who have taken at least 7 AP, University in the High School and/or Honors classes, and who represent the top 10% of their graduating class, or who have a cumulative average of 94% and above, whichever is greater.</li>
