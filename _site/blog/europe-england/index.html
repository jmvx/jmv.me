<p>We took a train from Edinburgh to London and spent our final week in a small London flat with two flatmates. We also joined a tour group that allowed us to also visit Windsor, Stonehenge, and Bath.</p>

<p>The tour guide at the BBC London had us take part in a mock radio show. Ryan played the role of “The Prince” and the staff commented on Ryan’s “California twang”.</p>

<p>We arrived just in time for the Sherlock Holmes Museum at 221B Baker Street. However, it wasn’t clear that the line outside the museum was <i>not</i> the line to buy tickets. They denied us admission since they closed the registers before we reached the door. Note to self: Buy tickets in the gift shop first, <i>then</i> get in line.</p>

<img src="/images/mi6-headquarters.jpg" class="large center" />
<p>We saw the SIS Building (Secret Intelligence Service). Commonly known as MI6 Headquarters.</p>

<img src="/images/windsor-castle.jpg" class="large center" />
<p>We saw the Changing of the Guard at Windsor Castle. We also got yelled at by our tour guide for taking too long on our tour. We almost missed our tour bus… Oops?</p>

<p>This photo shows only a small portion of an immense underground Roman Bath house in Bath, England.</p>

<img src="/images/tower-of-london.jpg" class="large center" />
<p>Our visit to the Tower of London started with a tour led by a Yeoman Warder who talked about the high-profile executions that took place at the tower. Afterwards, we saw the crown jewels, which are located in a large vault. There is a moving walkway to keep visitors from staring at the jewels too long. We weren’t allowed to take pictures of the jewels.</p>

<img src="/images/alan-turing.jpg" class="large center" />
<p>We visited Alan Turing on his birthday at Bletchley Park on June 23.</p>

<p>We also “visited” Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy.</p>
