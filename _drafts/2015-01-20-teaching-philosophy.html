<p>After three years of teaching middle school math at a public school in San Jose, I decided to read through my "Summary Reflection" that I wrote for my graduation portfolio at Stanford University. This blog post is a response to my reflection and is an overview of my development as an educator.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
I used my students’ prior knowledge of graphing and solving x- and y-intercepts for linear equations to create a learning segment that built off that knowledge to teach graphing and solving quadratic equations. I also provided students with an opportunity to apply their skill to a basic projectile motion problem that revolved around soccer, a pastime I discovered through a student survey in the beginning of the semester that students in my class were fond of.

<div class="blockquote">
Throughout the year, I sometimes differentiated curriculum by having students self-select problems to work on depending on their comfort level with a particular topic. I constantly adjust my teaching practices to accommodate for my students’ different learning needs and try to increase engagement and incorporate opportunities for more student input. 
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
I try to maintain an effective environment for learning where it is safe for students to make mistakes and where taking risks is valued. 
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
I also used stamps in my learning segment to indicate when students could move to the next task, which allowed me to be free to help other students instead of being occupied with retrieving papers for students who already completed the tasks.

In the future, I wish to find more ways to incorporate interdisciplinary strategies into my teaching. For instance, for the STEP conference, my conference group will be focusing on how math departments and science departments can work together to help students succeed in both subjects. In my final analysis for Literacies, I discussed how to develop literacy in my classroom by providing a context students can relate to in which to study mathematics. I focused on incorporating socially relevant topics in the classroom that bring in topics such as statistics or algebra as students analyze patterns data.

<div class="blockquote">
I focused on how we would hook the students into the problem and made no assumptions about what our students know about the game of basketball. We demonstrated basketball, showed a video, and brought a basketball in the classroom. In fact, there was a student in the class who did not know what basketball or a basketball hoop was. Only once we introduced what basketball was did we state the problem. “How do you get the ball in the hoop?”

<div class="blockquote">
I am working on being more transparent with the feedback I give to my students based on their assessments. At the moment, most of my feedback tends to be indirect or directed toward the class as a whole rather than the individual. I would like to give more individual feedback and communicate it to my students’ families more as well.

Finally, part of being a professional educator is having a balance between work and personal life. I try to produce high quality materials for my students while not sacrificing my well being. Over the year, I have also learned to better manage my time and energy when lesson planning, so I can get enough sleep to be an alert and effective teacher for my students.
