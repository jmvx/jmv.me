<p>Ryan and I rushed to the Exploratorium so we could [try to] be first in line for the Birdly exhibit. Birdly is a bird flight simulator developed at Zurich University of the Arts. You kneel in the simulator, resting on your stomach, and spread your arms across the wings. Once you have put on the Oculus Rift and noise cancelling headphones, you press a red button that sends you "flying".</p>

<p>There is a fan mounted in front of you to simulate wind. You can look in any direction and instead use your wings to steer. However, if you crash in the simulation, your turn is over. So, I chose to stay higher in the air hoping to maximize my flight time. Eventually, the Birdly engineer suggested I take a nose dive. When you fly downward in the simulation, it feels a lot like the first drop of a rollercoaster. The whole experience was a little disorienting at first, but you get used to it.</p>

<p>The flight lasts about three minutes (or so they say). When we first got in line, they were telling everyone that we would each get five minutes of flying time. It was eventually lowered to three minutes, but you'll notice my video is only two minutes long and it starts with me getting situated in the equipment... and I didn't even crash. I luckily only waited one hour for my turn (some people waited for three), but it was still a lot of waiting for less than two minutes of actual flying...</p> 
    
<p>I guess I will just need to buy one when it's finished to get my 3 minutes back. :)</p>
